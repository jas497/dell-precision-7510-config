# Configuration files for Dell Precision 7510 running Windows

## Key rebindings

Applying the registry file (double-click it) makes the following changes:

| Old key   | New key                      |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Calc      | Home                         |
| &#9198;   | End                          |
| &#9199;   | Page Up                      |
| &#9197;   | Page Down                    |
| Page Up   | Right-mouse button (AppsKey) |
| Page Down | Right Windows key            |

Different remappings can be selected by modifying the registry file.

Log out and back in (or reboot) to make the changes take effect.

Testing with Windows 10 Pro with Anniversary Update (1607) reveals that the
length field does not appear to need to be correct.  Regardless, if you change
the number of remappings, the safest approach would be to change that to match.
